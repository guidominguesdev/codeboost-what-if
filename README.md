> The project is still in development, and the upcoming updates will focus on completing the responsive layout of the website.

## Adjustments and improvements

This is a [CodeBoost](https://codeboost.com.br/) course project that has been improved and adjusted from the original version presented in the course. The changes include:

- Added to the project: [ESLint](https://eslint.org/), [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/).
- Used `REM` instead of `PX` throughout the entire website.
- Style Guide updates/corrections.
- Correctly used `Link` and `Image` components from Next.js in the CardCharacter component.
